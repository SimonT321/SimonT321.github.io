description: YouQueue was a semester-long group project for my Android Development class. The app creates a common queue which multiple users can add songs to. I was responsible for integrating the Spotify API and SDK to search for songs, add songs, and play songs. I learned about using APIs, parsing data, and interacting with a database.
