description: 'While stuck indoors due to the rainy Washington winters, I became really interested in solving Rubiks Cubes. I tried solving 2x2, 3x3, and 4x4 cubes. I was able to solve 2x2’s fairly consistently, but 3x3’s and 4x4’s presented a new challenge. That’s when I had the idea to create a program that represents an NxN cube.


I created a python progam that creates an NxN cube with 6 different colors. I implemented the 3 different rotations for each face. I found this project to be quite fun, but I would like to create a graphical representation of the cube for my next iteration. Picturing the cube rotations as arrays of text on the terminal was somewhat difficult. Another goal I have for the next iteration is a cube solver. Although I am not too familiar with the algorithms involved in solving a cube, I think implementing a generalized algorithm in code would give me a better understanding of how to solve a cube.
