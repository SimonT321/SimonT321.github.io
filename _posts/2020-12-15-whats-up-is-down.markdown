description: 'What’s Up Is Down is a 2-D platformer game built from the ground up in Unity for a Software Engineering semester long project. The player can rotate the map in 90 degree increments either clockwise or counter-clockwise. The goal of the game is to reach the end portal while collecting coins and gems, avoiding falling off platforms, and solving which rotations are required to progress through the stage.


I was was responsible for programming scripts that handled platform types, coin/gem collection, and the end portal. The game featured two different platform types- a rectangular platform that rotates around its center and a "pendulum" platform that rotates around a fixed orbit point. Platform rotations are triggered by the player touching the platform. This required learning how to use box colliders, touch input, and scripting to make the platforms perform as expected. The coins and gems required detecting the player colliding with the coin and gem objects. I then incremented the counters on the display to reflect the current count of each item. Implementing the end portal was similar to coin and gem collection, but I also learned how to use animated sprites in Unity.


Overall, this was a great project to take on. It was quite fun to create course designs with the components we worked at the end of the semester. My team and I had not done any development in Unity or C# before, so it was fulfilling to see our progress and ability increase throughout the semester. The end product was enjoyable to play and was a tangible reward for our hard work throughout the semester.
