Hello, I am currently an Implementation Consultant at <a href="https://www.fastenterprises.com/">Fast Enterprises</a> in Olympia, Washington. I work alongside the Washington Department of Revenue on production support which involves developing feature requests and bug fixes.

I graduated from the <a href="https://www.cs.wisc.edu/">University of Wisconsin - Madison</a> in May 2021 with a B.S. in Computer Science. While in college, I worked at the <a href="https://csl.cs.wisc.edu/docs/csl/2012-08-16-staff/">Computer Systems Lab</a> as a Lead Student System Administrator.
